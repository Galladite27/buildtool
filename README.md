# Buildtool
## A simple script to manage the use of autotools
This script aims to complete the following:
- Shorten the commands required to simple ones, such as "./buildtool build"
- Be easily modifiable to add more commands
- Be very lightweight (94 lines of shell last time I checked)
- Remove unnecessary files during all but debug builds to keep the root directory clean
